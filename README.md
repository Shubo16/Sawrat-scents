# Fragrance react web app

A fragrance store website made in react, helping me to understand the use of components, another task in playng around in flexbox, becoming more familiar of tailwind css (in terms of installation, media queries and ensuring its responsiveness) and use of javascript within jsx and react. A store that should set the tone of luxury, feel simple and usable and allow users to easily navigate the page itself.

# Time taken and issues etc

Five hours:
Time spent on playin around with colours, buttons and animations took a while. Understanding how media responsiveness worked also took some time, although it does feel a little easier and more time efficient compared to that of css.
Although i do feel that standard css or scss feels a lot more free to use. Doesn't feel as restricted although that was in one instance that I had this issue when I wanted to do something specific to my footer section. I wanted the text to center off in the end but tailwind doesnt allow that. To get around this issue i was able to figure out that i can make custom tailwind css configurations to allow this to happen which does help massively and gives me a good insight to what I may be able to do in the future with tailwind. 

# Future improvements and additions

What i plan on doing next is most likely creating the store itself, which has already been planned out. Ill be creating and using a grid system that will also be responsive and will make sure i can such features to 'sort by', e.g name, price and gender. I also want to incorporate the use new header as the header i had previously created i didnt like at all, however this could just be my problem with being a little picky or making things look as percect as possible.
